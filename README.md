# V2I-Simulator

Problem Statement:
The development of a vehicle-infrastructure simulator to test and analyze various
traffic management methods, decrease average wait times, and cut carbon
emission

## Objectives

● To simulate various types of vehicles and environment.

● To design an algorithm to reduce wait time at traffic signals and carbon emissions
for all types of vehicles.

● To analyze different algorithms on various scenarios.

● To apply multiple algorithms to control the congestion of high traffic in a lane.

● To predict the number of vehicles that are going to arrive in each lane for better
traffic optimization
